course project

Background

User Modeling System(UMS) is often used in web-based online environments in many domains. Especially in some web-based online courses, UMS tracks and models students’ learning activities and store this data as input data of the algorithms it uses. Therefore, building an efficient UMS is a crucial task.

In most online learning courses for users, the students’ models consist of two types of data, static and dynamic. The former represents the students’ information like the username, password, personal profile and so on, while the latter represents the domain-related data. It represents the students’ educational activities such as sum of pages viewed by students, time spent on page views, exam performance, some certain key strokes, and so on.

The main challenges of the user modeling systems algorithms are the deci- sions of what type of domain-related data is useful and the evaluation of this data. The probabilistic (the Bayes Classifier) and the instance-based (the k-NN classifier) models have been widely used to meet these challenges. An improved genetic algorithm based k-NN classifier was also introduced with a good performance.

Baseline Work

Our project is based on the research on intuitive classifier by Kahraman, Sagiroglu and Colak(2013) [1]. The group tested the performance of sev- eral classifiers including Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbor on user knowledge dataset and proposed a genetic approach for training classifiers.

On such basis, we have also tried other new methods beyond the instance- based models as tree-based models like Decision Tree and Random Forest and numeric method like Support Vector Machine.
